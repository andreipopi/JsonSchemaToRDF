 - If a new class is added in the second stage (because it was nested), its properties will just be listed in the vocabulary, but they will  not be attached to the class itself through rdf:Property. 
 Since the new properties are added to the mapping of existing properties, the second nested class having the same properties, will have them attached. See Per_km_pricing VS Per_min_pricing in system_pricing.ttl.
