# JSON Schema to RDF

This is a component tailored to the current GBFS use case and json schema structure.
It transforms GBFS JSON schemas into corresponding RDF vocabularies and Shacl shapes.

## How to use

 * Install dependencies using `npm install`
 * Build the typescript using `npm run build`
 * Run jsonschema2rdf by running `node main.js`


Program flow:
    * the `files` folder contains GBFS json schemas.
    * the build `folder` contains the vocabularies and shapes generated by the component.
    * foreach json schema in `files`, `main.ts`instantiates a `Configuration.ts`to set the basic info of the vocabulary; it then instantiates `rdfVocabulary.ts`to create the equivalent vocabulary and shape.
    * `rdfVocabulary.ts`is responsible for creating both the vocabulary and shapes.
    * `rdfVocabulary.ts` uses `shaclShape.ts` to initialize the basics of the shape such as the target class, and to get the corresponding property shapes.
