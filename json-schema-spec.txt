JSON Schema asserts what a JSON document must look like, ways to extract information from it, and how to interact with it.
JSON Schema is a JSON media type for defining the structure of JSON data. 
JSON Schema is intended to define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation, and interaction control of JSON data.

JSON Schema uses keywords to assert constraints on JSON instances or annotate those instances with additional information.



Core Vocabulary that must be supported by any implementation:

$ (means it is required)

json schema keywords categories:

- assertions (instance satisfies constraints)
- annotations (attach information)
- applicators (apply subschemas to parts of the instance)

- extension


*Lexical / Dynamic Scope

The lexical scope of a keyword is determined by the nested JSON data structure of objects and arrays. 



JSON Schema Core: a schema defined by the following keywords:

- $schema (decalres a meta-schema)
    useful for: - declaring vocabularies in use with $Vocabulary
                - describing valid schema syntax
                Each vocabulary typically identifies a meta-schema consisting 
                only of the vocabulary's keywords.

$schema: json schema dialect identifier/ identifier of a resource
         (must be an URI containing a scheme)

$vocabulary: 

$id: canonical URI
    The presence of "$id" in a subschema indicates that the subschema 
    constitutes a distinct schema resource within a single schema document.
